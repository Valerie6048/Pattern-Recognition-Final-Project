# Pattern Recognition Final Project

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
In this final project, the goal is to build a machine-learning model for predicting water potability based on various water quality parameters. The dataset includes information on pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, turbidity, and the target variable, potability.


## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>
### Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Load the dataset and explore its structure.
- Clean the data by handling missing values, interpolating data, and removing outliers.
- Perform feature engineering if needed.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of water quality parameters.
- Understand the relationships between different features.
- Analyze statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlations.

### Model Building
- Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, Logistic Regression) to predict water potability.
- Train the models on a training set and evaluate them on a validation set.

### Model Evaluation
- Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.
- Compare different algorithms to select the most suitable one.

### Streamlit Dashboard
- Create a Streamlit dashboard for an interactive user interface.
- Allow users to input new data, and the trained model predicts water potability.
- Integrate visualizations, including count plots and heatmaps, into the Streamlit app.

## üôè Conclusion <a name = "Conclusion"></a>
- Summarize findings and insights gained from the data.
- Discuss recommendations or further steps, such as refining the model, exploring additional features, or improving data quality.

This overview provides a high-level understanding of the Pattern Recognition Final Project, covering key steps from data exploration to model deployment through a Streamlit dashboard.
